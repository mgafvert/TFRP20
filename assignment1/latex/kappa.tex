\maketitle
As external students we have solved the assignment individually with in-group discussions as needed and with review and demonstration of the final codes. Both solutions are provided in the \texttt{othello-ah.zip} and \texttt{othello-mg.zip} archives, and we suggest that either one (randomly selected) or both solutions may be used for grading, as we understand the desire for course staff to keep a reasonable workload and review only one solution per group.
